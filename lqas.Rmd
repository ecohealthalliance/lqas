# Outline

* What is LQAS?

* How to perform LQAS

    - Statistical design
    - Sampling design

* Case Study: Sierra Leone National CMAM Coverage Survey

* Possible applications to One Health programmes

---

# What is LQAS?

* analytical approach for robust classification of "lots" (e.g., *set of outputs or products*, *service delivery units*, *programme areas*) based on a pre-determined standard or cut-off;

* devised and used in industry/manufacturing for performing quality assurance at minimal cost;

* adopted in health to assess prevalence of specific conditions, to assess programme quality, or to determine health care service delivery performance

* cost reduction is achieved primarily through much smaller sample size requirements.

---

# LQAS - statistical design

* LQAS is more an analysis technique than a sampling approach;

* classifies rather than estimates - answers the question:

**"How many true values do I need to find from a representative sample in order for me to determine that the whole lot is above or below a given standard?"**

---

# LQAS - statistical design

To answer this question, we need to:

* **determine standards** - should be pre-determined and should be based on either empirically verified values or agreed norms/standards

* **determine sample size** - sample size calculation is based on the 1) standards used; 2) the maximum acceptable $\alpha$ error (false positives); 3) maximum acceptable $\beta$ error (false negatives); and 4) population (to allow for finite population correction)

* These parameters will allow us to make a sampling plan to answer the earlier question:

$$ d ~ = ~ \left \lfloor{n ~ \times ~ \frac{p}{100}} \right \rfloor $$

# LQAS - example

Assume that in the specific lot / study area, the total population is 500 individuals. We want to assess whether the prevalence of Disease X in the population is at least 50% with a maximum acceptable $\alpha$ error of 10% and a maximum acceptable $\beta$ error of 10%.

---

# LQAS - sampling plan

* Sample size - see sample size table; see http://www.brixtonhealth.com/hyperLQAS.html

* Calculate *decision rule*

$$ d ~ = ~ \left \lfloor{37 ~ \times ~ \frac{50}{100}} \right \rfloor ~ = ~ \left \lfloor{18.5} \right \rfloor ~ = ~ 18 $$

* We will need to find more than 18 cases to classify this area as having a Disease X prevalence of at least 50%

---

# LQAS - survey design

* Once you have a sampling plan, designing the survey and sampling itself will be based on any other probabilistic survey design;

* Ensure sampling units within the lot have an equal chance of being selected;

* If using cluster sampling, account for design effect;

* Can use simple random sampling, systematic random sampling, spatial sampling approaches

# CMAM and Sierra Leone

.pull-left[
  
* Assess the coverage of treatment programme for severe acute undernutrition (wasting) in children under 5
  
* Severe wasting is rare; up to 5% in famine situations; typical high values about 2-3% in "normal" times
  
* Team of district level health managers were trained to conduct LQAS in each of the 14 districts of Sierra Leone (the "lots")

.pull-right[

* Surveys took 3-4 days per district; on last day, team was able to report immediately the results for the district

* Only 3 out of 14 districts performed moderately with a CMAM coverage of between 20% and 50%

]

# Results - table

.pull-left[

* Data collected from each lot can be aggregated to estimate coverage throughout the country
  
* Coverage estimate for the whole country was at 19.7% (15.7% - 23.7%)

# Data system

.pull-left[

* Survey/study was simple enough that data system was mainly paper-based

# Analysis

.pull-left[

* Analysis approach was simple enough that it can be done at real time with results reportable as soon as the survey/study is finished
